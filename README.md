<h2>Ping Pong</h2>
<p>
Welcome to my Ping Pong game, created for the Global Hack Week: Game Week hackathon! This classic arcade-style game was built using Python and the Pygame library, and offers an engaging and fun experience for players of all ages.
</p>
<p>
Our Ping Pong game features intuitive controls, smooth gameplay, and customizable settings to make the game as challenging or easy as you'd like. You can adjust the speed of the ball, the size of the paddles, and even the level of wobbliness in the paddles themselves!

<p>
In addition, my Ping Pong game includes an intro screen and a pause screen to enhance the overall user experience. And with its clear, clean graphics and straightforward design, it's easy to pick up and play right away.

So whether you're looking for a fun way to pass the time or a challenging new gaming experience, give our Ping Pong game a try! It's free, open-source, and available on GitHub for anyone to download, use, and modify.
